					<h4>From today's featured article</h4>
					<p>The production of renewable energy in Scotland is a topic that came to the fore in technical, economic, and political terms during the opening years of the 21st century.[2] The natural resource base for renewable energy is high by European, and even global standards, with the most important potential sources being wind, wave, and tide. Renewables generate almost all of Scotland's electricity, mostly from the country's wind power.[3]In 2020, Scotland had 12 gigawatts (GW) of renewable electricity capacity, which produced about a quarter of total UK renewable generation.[4] In decreasing order of capacity, Scotland's renewable generation comes from onshore wind, hydropower, offshore wind, solar PV and biomass.[5] Scotland exports much of this electricity.[6][7] Continuing improvements in engineering and economics are enabling more of the renewable resources to be used. Fears regarding fuel poverty[8] and climate change have driven the subject high up the political agenda. In 2020 a quarter of total energy consumption, including heat and transportation, was met from renewables and the Scottish government target is half by 2030.[9] Although the finances of some projects remain speculative or dependent on market incentives there has been a significant and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.[10][11] In addition to planned increases in large-scale generating capacity using renewable sources, various related schemes to reduce carbon emissions are being researched.[12] Although there is significant support from the public, private and community-led sectors, concerns about the effect of the technologies on the natural environment have been expressed. There is also a political debate about the relationship between the siting, and the ownership and control of these widely distributed resources.[13][14] Even though the claim that Scotland had 25% of the EU's potential wind power was repeated on multiple occasions, this was shown to be incorrect after several FOI requests [25] ,and estimated to be between 4 and 6 percent. It should be borne in mind that electricity production is only part of the overall energy use budget. In 2002, Scotland consumed a total of 175 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy in all forms, some 2% less than in 1990. Of this, only 20% was consumed in the form of electricity by end users, the great majority of energy utilised is from the burning of oil (41%) and gas (36%).[26][20] Nonetheless, the renewable electricity generating capacity may be 60 GW or more, greater than required to provide the existing energy provided from all Scottish fuel sources of 157 TWh.[15][17][27] 2002 figures used as a baseline in RSPB Scotland et al. (2006) for electricity production are: gas (34%), oil (28%), coal (18%) and nuclear (17%), with renewables 3% (principally hydro-electric), prior to the substantial growth in wind power output.[17] In January 2006 the total installed electrical generating capacity from all forms of renewable energy was less than 2 GW, about a fifth of the total electrical production.[15] Scotland also has significant quantities of fossil fuel deposits, including substantial proven reserves of oil and gas[28] and 69% of UK coal reserves.[16] Nonetheless, the Scottish Government has set ambitious targets for renewable energy production. In 2005 the aim was for 18% of Scotland's electricity production to be generated by renewable sources by 2010, rising to 40% by 2020.[29] In 2007 this was increased to 50% of electricity from renewables by 2020, with an interim target of 31% by 2011.[30][31] The following year new targets to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 were announced and then confirmed in the 2009 Climate Change Delivery Plan. Maf Smith, director of the Sustainable Development Commission in Scotland said "Governments across the world are shying away from taking the necessary action. The Scottish Government must be commended for its intention to lead the way".[32][33] Most electricity in Scotland is carried through the National Grid, with Scotland's renewable mix thus contributing to the electricity production of Great Britain as a whole.[34] By 2012, over 40% of Scotland's electricity came from renewable energy, and Scotland contributed almost 40% of the UK's renewables output. At the end of that year there was 5,801 megawatts (MW) of installed renewables electricity capacity, an increase of 20.95% (1,005 MW) on the end of 2011. Renewable electricity generation in 2012 was a record high at 14,756 GWh – an increase of 7.3% on 2011, the previous record year for renewables output.[35] In 2015, Scotland generated 59% of its electricity consumption through renewable sources, exceeding the country's goal of 50% renewable electricity by that year.[36] In 2018, Scotland exported over 28% of electricity generation to the rest of the UK.[6] By 2019 renewable electricity generation was 30,528 GWh, over 90% of Scotland's gross electricity consumption (33,914 GWh) and 21% of overall energy use was produced from renewable sources, against Scottish Government targets of 100% by 2020 and 50% by 2030 respectively.[7][37] Scotland aims to produce 50% of all energy (not just electricity) from renewable sources by 2030.[38] At the start of 2020, Scotland had 11.8 gigawatts (GW) of installed renewable electricity capacity which produced approximately 25% of total UK renewable generation (119,335 GWh).[4] It remains a policy of the Scottish Government to reduce emissions to net zero by 2045.[12]

				<h4>In the news</h4>
				<p>Starship is a super heavy-lift space launch vehicle under development by SpaceX. At 120 m (390 ft) in height and with a liftoff mass of 5,000 metric tons (11,000,000 lb), Starship is the largest and most powerful launch vehicle ever flown, and the first intended to be fully reusable.[3] The Starship launch vehicle consists of the first stage Super Heavy booster and the second stage Starship spacecraft. Both stages are powered by the Raptor rocket engine, which burns liquid oxygen and liquid methane propellants in a highly complex but efficient full-flow staged combustion power cycle. Both rocket stages are designed to be reusable, performing controlled landings on the launch tower and reflown within hours. Starship is planned to have a payload capacity of 150 t (330,000 lb) to low Earth orbit in a fully reusable configuration and 250 t (550,000 lb) when expended.[4] Starship vehicles in low Earth orbit can be refilled with propellant launched in other tanker Starships to enable transit to higher energy destinations such as geosynchronous orbit, the Moon, and Mars. Plans for a heavy lift vehicle at SpaceX date back to 2005, with the earliest concept resembling the modern vehicle announced in 2016. Starship development follows an iterative and incremental approach involving frequent—and often destructive—test flights of incomplete vehicles, with flight data guiding future engineering efforts. The first orbital test flight attempt, on April 20, 2023, ended after the vehicle was destroyed four minutes into its flight.SpaceX plans for Starship to eventually become its primary launch vehicle, superseding the existing fleet of Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon spacecraft, and is often coupled with the company's Mars ambitions. Planned Starship flights include the build-out of SpaceX's Starlink internet constellation, crewed flights under the Polaris and dearMoon programs, and a crewed lunar landing with a modified Starship spacecraft under the Artemis program. Starship's development is iterative and incremental, using intensive tests on a series of rocket prototypes.[18][19] The first prototype, Starhopper, performed several static fires and low-altitude flights.[20] Seven of Starship's upper stage prototypes were flight tested between August 2020 and May 2021. The last of the seven, a full-size Starship SN15, successfully landed after reaching an altitude of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi).[21] A full-scale orbital test flight of the rocket took place on April 20, 2023.[22] Starship prototype tests can generally be classified into three main types. In proof pressure tests, the vehicle's tanks are pressurized with either gases or liquids to test their strength—sometimes deliberately until they burst. The vehicle then performs mission rehearsals, with or without propellant, to check the vehicle and ground infrastructure. Before a test flight, SpaceX loads the vehicle prototype with propellant and briefly fires its engines in a static fire test.[23]: 18–19  Alternatively, the engines' turbopump spinning can be tested without firing the engines, referred to as a spin prime test.[24] After successful testing, uncrewed flight tests and launches may commence. During a suborbital launch, Starship prototypes fly to a high altitude and descend, landing either near the launch site, in the sea, or onto offshore platforms. During an orbital launch, Starship performs procedures as described in its mission profile.[23]: 19–22  Due to SpaceX's relative openness for outsiders to peer into the facilities, Starship rocket tests, flights, and launches have received significant media coverage.[25] Stacked and fueled, Starship is about 5,000 t (11,000,000 lb) by mass,[b] 9 m (30 ft) wide,[72] and 120 m (390 ft) high. While the prototype versions of Starship are not reused, Starship is designed to be a fully reusable and orbital rocket, to reduce launch costs and maintenance between flights.[73] Its fully reusable configuration has a payload capacity of 150 t (330,000 lb) to low Earth orbit and the expended configuration has a payload capacity of 250 t (550,000 lb).[4] The rocket will consist of a Super Heavy first stage or a booster and a Starship second stage or spacecraft,[3] powered by Raptor and Raptor Vacuum engines.[74] The bodies of both rocket stages are made from stainless steel, giving Starship its strength for atmospheric entry and distinctive look.[75] According to Eric Berger of Ars Technica, the manufacturing process starts with rolls of steel, which are unrolled, cut, and welded along the cut edge to create a cylinder 9 m (30 ft) in diameter, 2 m (7 ft) in height, and around 1,600 kg (4,000 lb) in mass. These cylinders, along with the nose cones, are stacked and welded along their edges to form the outer layer of the rocket. Inside, the methane and oxygen tanks are separated by the robot-made domes.[76] Also according to Berger, Starship's reusability and stainless-steel construction has influenced the Terran R rocket[77] and Project Jarvis's second stage.[78]</p>

				<p>The Orchid Pavilion Gathering, also known as the Lanting Gathering, was a cultural and poetic event held in China in 353, during the Jin dynasty of the Six Dynasties era. During the Spring Purification Festival, forty-two literati met at the Orchid Pavilion (Lanting) on Mount Kuaiji, near present-day Shaoxing in Zhejiang. This 7th-century scroll, now at the Palace Museum in Beijing, is considered to be the best of the surviving copies of the Lantingji Xu, written by Wang Xizhi as a preface to the collection of poems produced at the Orchid Pavilion Gathering. Copies of the work were made throughout Chinese history. The text reads, in part: "Reading past compositions, I can recognize the same melancholy from the ancients. I can only lament before their words without being able to verbalize my feelings. [...] The future generations will look upon us, just like we look upon our past. How sad! Hence, we record the people presented here today and their works; Even though time and circumstances will be different, the feelings expressed will remain unchanged." It is said that the origin of this festival comes from the Dinner Party at the Qushui River during the Zhou Dynasty (about 1100–221 BC). Others say its origins come from the ceremonial custom of getting rid of evils by bathing in the river. On this day, people would hold a sacrificing ceremony on a riverside to honor their ancestors, and then take a bath in the river with herbs to cleanse their bodies of filth. Following that, young men and women would then go for a spring outing in which many of these scenes were described in Shi Jing (The Book of Songs).The Shangsi Festival activities have changed over the course of subsequent dynasties. The entertainment feast and praying for descendants along the riverside were added in the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). It was after the Wei and Jin dynasties (220–420 AD) that the festival developed into the Double-Third (Shangsi) Festival that is fixed on the third day of the third lunar month. In modern times, to observe this festival, people would go for an outing by the water, have picnics, and pluck orchids. It is also a day for invoking cleansing rituals to prevent disease and get rid of bad luck. The day is also traditionally considered to be a possible birthday of the Yellow Emperor.[1] The ancient traditions of Shangsi are mostly celebrated by several communities spread out among the provinces today, such as the ancient village of Xinye which holds elaborate ancestor worship ceremonies on this day.[2][3] The great calligrapher Wang Xizhi mentions this festival in his famous work Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Poems, written in regard to the Orchid Pavilion Gathering during the Six Dynasties era.</p>
